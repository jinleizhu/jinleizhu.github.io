    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a plant ecologist. I am doing my postdoctoral research at <a href="https://ecology.uni-hohenheim.de/" title="Institute of Landscape and Plant Ecology" target="_blank">Institute of Landscape and Plant Ecology, University of Hohenheim</a>.</p>
    <p>By far, all my research has been focusing on just one question: <strong>How far do seeds move in nature?</strong> </p>
    <p>Why is this question important? Most obviously, because plants, by definition, can not move voluntarily during their whole life. For seed plants, which constitute the great majority of the kingdom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant" title="plant" target="_blank">Plantae</a>, the only way to spread their next generations is to spread their seeds away from themselves. Actually plants are everywhere on planet Earth, and some of them are so successful that they even become invasive.</p>
    <p>Studying seed movement thus is important. However, seeds normally don't move by themselves--they need to be moved by others. The scientific term, referring to the process of movement of seeds from their parent, is "seed dispersal". Seeds of most plant species are dispersed by multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms either involve different vectors (e.g. wind vs. animals) or different ways in which the same vector moves seeds. As an example for the latter, wind can disperse seeds both through the air (primary wind dispersal) or across the ground (secondary wind dispersal). Secondary seed dispersal includes all movement of seeds over the ground before they germinate or they are trapped permanently. No matter how many times a seed moves during this period. That said, we don't use the term "third dispersal", "fourth dispersal", etc. </p>
    <p>Since I started my doctoral study in 2010, I have been working on mechanisms for seed dispersal by wind. To do so, I use wind-tunnel experiments and mechanistic modelling.</p>
    <h3>My Latest Publication</h3>
    <p>We have just published a paper: <a href="https://rdcu.be/buWye" title="paper in Plant Ecology" target="_blank">A trade-off between primary and secondary seed dispersal by wind</a>.</P>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Outside the office, I
      <ul>
	<li>go climbing. My favorite sport, always keen on it whenever possible.</li>
	<li>go running. My record for half-marathon is 1 hour 18 minutes.</li>
	<li>play soccer. After having been in Germany for more than three years, I finally started playing soccer with my colleagues.</li>
      </ul>
